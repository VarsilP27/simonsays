                    Though I had started web development in 2002, it was years before I considered it as a career. I decided to re-skill following a severe accident which occured while I was a low-voltage installer. I applied and was accepted to Georgian College in Barrie, ON for the Web Design and Animation program. Our focus was responsive design and the semantic web. We had courses on client management, information architecture, and SEO, in addition to our design and development courses.

                    In our second term, we learned the basics of WordPress. A few classmates and I acquired a client, (Kate's Kart) who needed a website to replace their current one. We developed the website with many application features, such as a custom food menu editor, and a geo-located guestbook that would auto-locate guests based on their IP address, or the address they added.
                </p>

                    GShift required me to build a reporting system for a large client (BDO). I chose Rails, as gShift's main SaaS product used the same technology, and it would be good practice going forward. During my time with gShift I learned how to connect to APIs using basic auth and OAuth methods. We utilized AWS, LinkedIn, Facebook Graph, and Google APIs to collect data for client analysis.
